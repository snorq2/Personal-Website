        I am Sawyer Norquist, engager of thought and things. In particular, I
        enjoy taking problems and constructing solutions for them – both novel
        and based on tried methodology. While this has led many places, most
        recently it has been through a time as an Operational Excellence
        technician. During this time I built a substantial interest in
        systems-level approaches to problem solving, viewing most puzzles not as
        isolated instances but as some part of a greater whole. I used this
        approach in tasks such as helping redesign the flow of a production line
        to establishing a new process for handling non-conformance reporting for
        both materials and processes. Now I seek to grow these skills even
        further, pursing a bachelor’s in Computer Science with the goal of
        transitioning to a development role – ideally in a role where I can
        combine my experience with Lean, Six Sigma methodology, and the
        production environment to continue building systems and solving
        problems.
